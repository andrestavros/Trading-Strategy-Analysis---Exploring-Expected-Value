# Trading Strategy Analysis | Exploring Expected Value
The purpose of this analysis was to determine which trading strategies have positive or negative EV(expected value) and to identfiy higher performing subsets of positive EV strategies. 

Data mining approach: whenever a trading setup occurred, a series of data points were collected on the setup date as well as the following day. For each observation, the study period spans two days. 
The strategy involves entering a trade on Day 1 and holding the position until the end of Day 2, while analyzing how price behaves over that interval. data is collected from the time the trading strategy criteria is met (day 1) until end of day 2. 

Observations were collected over the span of one year.
